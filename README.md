## Contents
The **Machine Learning Engineering for Production (MLOps) Specialization** covers how to conceptualize, build, and maintain integrated systems that continuously operate in production. In striking contrast with standard machine learning modeling, production systems need to handle relentless evolving data. Moreover, the production system must run non-stop at the minimum cost while producing the maximum performance. In this Specialization, you will learn how to use well-established tools and methodologies for doing all of this effectively and efficiently.

**Main topics of this specialization**:
- Design an ML production system end-to-end: project scoping, data needs, modeling strategies, and deployment requirements
- Establish a model baseline, address concept drift, and prototype how to develop, deploy, and continuously improve a productionized ML application
- Build data pipelines by gathering, cleaning, and validating datasets
- Implement feature engineering, transformation, and selection with TensorFlow Extended
- Establish data lifecycle by leveraging data lineage and provenance metadata tools and follow data evolution with enterprise data schemas
- Apply techniques to manage modeling resources and best serve offline/online inference requests
- Use analytics to address model fairness, explainability issues, and mitigate bottlenecks
- Deliver deployment pipelines for model serving that require different infrastructures
- Apply best practices and progressive delivery techniques to maintain a continuously operating production system
